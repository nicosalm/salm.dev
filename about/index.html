                    Welcome to my website. The content here is centered around programming, statistics, psychology, philosophy, and history.

                    My technical interest spans big data systems, distributed computing, and statistical analysis. I work primarily in <span style="color: #3776ab;">Python</span>, <span style="color: #ce422b;">Rust</span>, <span style="color: #00add8;">Go</span>, <span style="color: #3178c6;">TypeScript</span>, and <span style="color: #336791;">SQL</span>. I'm particularly drawn to solving the hard systems questions that make large-scale data science possible—and in the hidden layers that shape UX from behind the scenes.

                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy reading fantasy novels and historical texts, drawing and cartography, playing D&D 5e and strategy games (Total War, ArmA, isometric RPGs), and long-distance running around Madison.

        <p>
            I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. I spend most of my time hanging out in the <a href="https://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/" target="blank">Undergraduate Projects Lab</a> on campus with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a list of some of my favorite classes:
        </p>

            Writing
        </h2>
        <p>
            I try to stay away from being prescriptive and instead prefer to frame my experiences and how I've learned or grown from them. I want to stay away from making sweeping or unsubstantiated claims about complex topics. I focus on my interests in programming, statistics, psychology, philosophy, and history, and that's what I <a href="/writing">write about</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am forever learning, and formulating my interests and perspective in essays allows me to refine my beliefs and understanding. I aim to put out a piece once per month. I am always open to critiques, fact checking, or revising to cover angles I did not anticipate.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Colophon
        </h2>
        <p>
            A colophon is a brief statement that appears at the end of a book, providing information about its production. I got the idea from <a href="https://www.amoses.dev/" target="_blank">Andrew</a>, and while I don't believe I will do as great a job as he did with his, here is my best shot:

        <p>
            There's a running joke among my friends that I go through many websites. This one will hopefully stand the test of time. I've had a lot of fun writing this using only HTML/CSS with a build.sh script, <a href="https://pandoc.org/" target="_blank">Pandoc</a>, and post templates for the blog. I have enjoyed that I have to figure things out rather than getting features out of the box, as it forces me to really consider what I actually want.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site is intentionally minimal, with no JavaScript except for conditional loading of MathJax on blog posts that require LaTeX rendering. Content is processed from Markdown files using Pandoc, creating a static site that's lightweight and fast. I subset all fonts using pyftsubset to include only the characters actually used on each page. The simplicity of the system makes maintenance straightforward.
