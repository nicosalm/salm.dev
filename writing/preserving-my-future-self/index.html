                <p>I underwent an ergonomic overhaul to improve health
                and reduce strain. Or: I bought an expensive new
                split-keyboard. Either way, an adventure worth sharing.

                <p><strong>(!!!) - This post is being
                updated.</strong></p>
                <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
                <p>Humans have a natural aversion to change and it makes
                adjusting daily routines difficult. A month ago, I
                embarked on a journey to overhaul my typing experience
                by learning not just a new keyboard layout but also a
                new type of keyboard altoghether. I restructured my
                experience from the ground up, and wrote this post to
                share my impressions after a month of using a split,
                ortholinear keyboard called the <a
                href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">ZSA Voyager</a>. I
                paired this with the <a
                href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Colemak-DH
                keyboard layout</a>.</p>
                <p>But why? — Why go through so much work? Will it make
                me type blazingly fast? Well, no, although I believe the
                ceiling has been raised inadvertently.</p>
                <p>I chose to refactor my workflow for one reason alone:
                the vast ergonomic benefit which promises to preserve my
                physical health. I did this for me ten years from now<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn1" id="note1" title="Footnote 1">1</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn1"><a class="fnref" href="#note1" title="Footnote 1 Reference">1</a> As a programmer, I will spend the
                majority of my professional career at a desk!</span>.</p>
                <h2 id="rebuilding-muscle-memory">Rebuilding Muscle
                Memory</h2>
                <p>A lot of experts and articles will advise slowly
                adjusting to a new keyboard layout over time, perhaps
                adding in a small subsection of the keyboard each week.
                I think that is fair, but not for me<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn2" id="note2" title="Footnote 2">2</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn2"><a class="fnref" href="#note2" title="Footnote 2 Reference">2</a> I am a firm believer of ripping of the
                band-aid. I would rather get it all over in one go.</span>. Instead, I erased
                my muscle memory in one sweep and just went for it.</p>
                <p>I unplugged my old keyboard and set up my Voyager.
                Split keyboard, blank keycaps, and an entirely new
                keyboard schema with a symbols layer. Challenge
                accepted.</p>
                <p>I began with typing websites. I introduced one letter
                at a time, building familiarity.</p>
                <p>I saw gradual but consistent progression. It was like
                a game.</p>
                <p>I eventually unlocked the entire keyboard. Including
                numbers and symbols. After a month of practice, I’m now
                typing at ~70 wpm down from my previous average of
                ~125.</p>
                <p>In time, I transitioned from typing websites to real
                projects, coursework, and general day-to-day
                productivity. I see a strong linear trend and I am
                confident it is only a matter of time until I meet my
                old personal best.</p>
                <h2 id="breaking-down-the-changes">Breaking Down the
                Changes</h2>
                <p>I changed many things about my setup. I think there’s
                value in analyzing each change and the impact it brought
                my way.</p>
                <h3 id="the-voyager-split-keyboard">1. The Voyager Split
                Keyboard</h3>
                <p>The Voyager split keyboard is a revelation. My <a
                href="https://iqunix.store/collections/hitchhiker-series/products/f97-hitchhiker">IQUNIX
                F97 Hitchhiker</a> is an excellent pre-built keyboard,
                but the Voyager implements a handful of essential
                improvements. With the split design, my hands rest more
                naturally, and my shoulders are no longer pulled inward.
                This alignment improvement alone has made typing for
                extended periods significantly more comfortable and
                eased the constant, dull pain between my shoulder
                blades.</p>
                <h3 id="ortholinear-keys">2. Ortholinear Keys</h3>
                <p>Ortholinear keys, where keys are aligned in a grid
                rather than staggered, are simply better. The staggered
                design we’re all used to was born out of typewriter
                constraints, not ergonomics. With ortholinear keys,
                every finger’s movement feels more intentional and
                precise.</p>
                <h3 id="proper-10-finger-touch-typing">3. Proper
                10-Finger Touch-Typing</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest changes I’ve made is enforcing
                proper 10-finger touch-typing. Paired with the key
                layout of the Voyager, using all ten fingers has
                effectively eliminated moving my hand to reach for a
                key. Each finger is responsible for a column of keys on
                the keyboard. I also eliminated some of my bad habits!
                In the past, some fingers took on more responsibility
                than they ought to, and this fixed that.</p>
                <h3 id="colemak-dh-layout">4. Colemak-DH Layout</h3>
                <p>Colemak-DH takes the already ergonomic Colemak layout
                and makes it even better by keeping your most-used keys
                on the home row. It’s designed to minimize finger
                movement and keep your hands comfortable while typing.
                For someone like me, who spends a significant amount of
                time programming, the inclusion of a symbol layer (where
                symbols are mapped to easily accessible keys) is
                revolutionary. The result? A layout that’s not only
                ergonomic but also extremely fast.</p>
                <h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>While I’m optimizing my typing setup, it’s crucial
                not to overlook the importance of overall posture. After
                all, no keyboard layout can save you from the effects of
                poor posture. I’ve been paying close attention to my
                chair and how I sit while working. Ensuring that my
                chair supports a natural, upright posture is key to
                avoiding <a
                href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Upper-Crossed_Syndrome">upper
                crossed syndrome</a> — a condition where the muscles in
                the neck, shoulders, and chest become imbalanced due to
                poor posture. This syndrome can lead to neck pain,
                shoulder discomfort, and even headaches, which all
                suck.</p>
                <p>A close friend of mine worked for years unguarded at
                a desk and it caused them to lose 67% of the natural
                curvature in their spine. The resulting chiropractic
                bills came to $4,500. That was a huge wake-up call for
                me and played a significant role in justifying the money
                I spent on this new ergonomic setup. Investing in good
                equipment now feels like a small price to pay for
                long-term health and comfort.</p>
                <h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
                <p>Adopting this new keyboard setup is a commitment, but
                it’s one I’m excited about. I’ve even gamified the
                process with a website that tracks my typing progress
                and gives me a bunch of stats and charts to geek out
                over. As someone who will be programming for many more
                years, this feels like a worthwhile investment in my
                professional workflow.</p>
                <p>The journey is just beginning, and I look forward to
                seeing how much my typing speed and comfort improve over
                the coming months. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
