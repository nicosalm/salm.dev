            <p>I underwent an ergonomic overhaul to improve health and
            reduce strain. Or: I got a new, expensive keyboard that got

            sharing.</p>

            <p><strong>(!!!) - This post is being updated.</strong></p>
            <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
            <p>Humans have a natural aversion to change and it makes
            adjusting daily routines difficult. A month ago, I embarked
            on a journey to overhaul my typing experience by learning
            not just a new keyboard layout but also a new type of
            keyboard altoghether. I restructured my experience from the
            ground up, and wrote this post to share my impressions after
            a month of using a split, ortholinear keyboard called the <a
            href="https://www.zsa.io/voyager">ZSA Voyager</a>. I paired
            this with the <a
            href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Colemak-DH
            keyboard layout</a>.</p>
            <p>But why? — Why go through so much work? Will it make me
            type blazingly fast? Well, no, although I believe the
            ceiling has been raised inadvertently.</p>
            <p>I chose to refactor my workflow for one reason alone: the
            vast ergonomic benefit which promises to preserve my
            physical health. I did this for me ten years from now<a
            href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
            <h3 id="rebuilding-muscle-memory">Rebuilding Muscle
            Memory</h3>
            <p>A lot of experts and articles will advise slowly
            adjusting to a new keyboard layout over time, perhaps adding
            in a small subsection of the keyboard each week. I think
            that is fair, but not for me<a href="#fn2"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Instead, I erased my
            muscle memory in one sweep and just went for it.</p>
            <p>I unplugged my old keyboard and set up my Voyager. Split
            keyboard, blank keycaps, and an entirely new keyboard schema
            with a symbols layer. Challenge accepted.</p>
            <p>I began with typing websites. I introduced one letter at
            a time, building familiarity.</p>
            <p>I saw gradual but consistent progression. It was like a
            game.</p>
            <p>I eventually unlocked the entire keyboard. Including
            numbers and symbols. After a month of practice, I’m now
            typing at ~70 wpm down from my previous average of ~125.</p>
            <p>In time, I transitioned from typing websites to real
            projects, coursework, and general day-to-day productivity. I
            see a strong linear trend and I am confident it is only a
            matter of time until I meet my old personal best.</p>
            <h3 id="breaking-down-the-changes">Breaking Down the
            Changes</h3>
            <p>I changed many things about my setup. I think there’s
            value in analyzing each change and the impact it brought my
            way.</p>
            <h4 id="the-voyager-split-keyboard">1. The Voyager Split
            Keyboard</h4>
            <p>The Voyager split keyboard is a revelation. My <a
            href="https://iqunix.store/collections/hitchhiker-series/products/f97-hitchhiker">IQUNIX
            F97 Hitchhiker</a> is an excellent pre-built keyboard, but
            the Voyager implements a handful of essential improvements.
            With the split design, my hands rest more naturally, and my
            shoulders are no longer pulled inward. This alignment
            improvement alone has made typing for extended periods
            significantly more comfortable and eased the constant, dull
            pain between my shoulder blades.</p>
            <h4 id="ortholinear-keys">2. Ortholinear Keys</h4>
            <p>Ortholinear keys, where keys are aligned in a grid rather
            than staggered, are simply better. The staggered design
            we’re all used to was born out of typewriter constraints,
            not ergonomics. With ortholinear keys, every finger’s
            movement feels more intentional and precise.</p>
            <h4 id="proper-10-finger-touch-typing">3. Proper 10-Finger
            Touch-Typing</h4>
            <p>One of the biggest changes I’ve made is enforcing proper
            10-finger touch-typing. Paired with the key layout of the
            Voyager, using all ten fingers has effectively eliminated
            moving my hand to reach for a key. Each finger is
            responsible for a column of keys on the keyboard. I also
            eliminated some of my bad habits! In the past, some fingers
            took on more responsibility than they ought to, and this
            fixed that.</p>
            <h4 id="colemak-dh-layout">4. Colemak-DH Layout</h4>
            <p>Colemak-DH takes the already ergonomic Colemak layout and
            makes it even better by keeping your most-used keys on the
            home row. It’s designed to minimize finger movement and keep
            your hands comfortable while typing. For someone like me,
            who spends a significant amount of time programming, the
            inclusion of a symbol layer (where symbols are mapped to
            easily accessible keys) is revolutionary. The result? A
            layout that’s not only ergonomic but also extremely
            fast.</p>
            <h3 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h3>
            <p>While I’m optimizing my typing setup, it’s crucial not to
            overlook the importance of overall posture. After all, no
            keyboard layout can save you from the effects of poor
            posture. I’ve been paying close attention to my chair and
            how I sit while working. Ensuring that my chair supports a
            natural, upright posture is key to avoiding <a
            href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Upper-Crossed_Syndrome">upper
            crossed syndrome</a> — a condition where the muscles in the
            neck, shoulders, and chest become imbalanced due to poor
            posture. This syndrome can lead to neck pain, shoulder
            discomfort, and even headaches, which all suck.</p>
            <p>A close friend of mine worked for years unguarded at a
            desk and it caused them to lose 67% of the natural curvature
            in their spine. The resulting chiropractic bills came to
            $4,500. That was a huge wake-up call for me and played a
            significant role in justifying the money I spent on this new
            ergonomic setup. Investing in good equipment now feels like
            a small price to pay for long-term health and comfort.</p>
            <h3 id="conclusion-embracing-the-challenge">Conclusion:
            Embracing the Challenge</h3>
            <p>Adopting this new keyboard setup is a commitment, but
            it’s one I’m excited about. I’ve even gamified the process
            with a website that tracks my typing progress and gives me a
            bunch of stats and charts to geek out over. As someone who
            will be programming for many more years, this feels like a
            worthwhile investment in my professional workflow.</p>
            <p>The journey is just beginning, and I look forward to
            seeing how much my typing speed and comfort improve over the
            coming months. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
