                <p>Nothing technical today in the traditional sense;
                rather, I’ve come to share a bit of introspection. This
                morning I jotted down my “time wasters”—a list I feel
                almost anyone these days can relate to:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>not going to bed right away</li>
                <li>not waking up right away</li>
                <li>scrolling</li>
                <li>YouTube videos and short-form content</li>
                <li>Discord conversations</li>
                <li>“dooming”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> about
                big milestones I have not achieved</li>
                <li>using AI (*when passive)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Looking at this list, there’s a pattern I’ve been
                thinking about a lot recently: these are all low-effort
                activities that deliver quick dopamine hits. They feel
                rewarding in the moment, yet leave me empty
                afterward.</p>
                <p>It’s rather obvious that if something wastes your
                time, it is preventing you from doing other things. And
                though they may present reward in the moment, later, all
                you feel is regret. I’m training my brain to want
                instant gratification over doing hard things. Each time
                I pick the easy dopamine hit, finding motivation for
                real work becomes that much harder.</p>
                <p>And while I’ve identified this grouping of problems,
                I’m still far away from being able to conquer them
                myself.</p>

                obsessively dwelling on negative thoughts about future
                outcomes or personal failures, often worsened by social
                media comparisons and societal expectations about where
                you “should be” in life.<a href="#fnref1"

                <h2 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
                <p>Let me introduce some vocabulary to clarify this
                pattern.</p>
                <p>I’ll call these two opposing action sets
                <strong>consumptive</strong> versus
                <strong>generative</strong> behaviors:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Consumptive behaviors</strong> are
                low-effort activities that provide high momentary reward
                (scrolling feels good while you’re doing it) but offer
                little lasting reward (nothing meaningful to show for it
                afterward) and minimal dopamine upon completion (no real
                sense of accomplishment).</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Generative behaviors</strong> require
                effort and sustained attention, providing low or delayed
                momentary reward (the work feels hard initially) but
                high lasting reward (real skills, relationships, health,
                accomplishments) and significant dopamine upon
                completion (genuine satisfaction from finishing
                something worthwhile).</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The consumptive activities feel immediately rewarding
                but train your brain to crave easy gratification. The
                generative ones often feel difficult to start but
                gradually become more rewarding as your dopamine system
                recalibrates to appreciate sustained effort.</p>
                <h2 id="down-in-a-hole">Down in a Hole</h2>
                <p>I am no psychologist, but I believe the key point is
                this: <strong><em>your brain actively fights against
                choosing generative behaviors.</em></strong> It has been
                conditioned to expect easy dopamine hits, so when faced
                with something that requires effort—even something you
                know will ultimately be more fulfilling—your mind will
                push you toward the consumptive alternatives. It wants
                its quick fix.</p>
                <p>Daniel Lieberman calls this an “<a
                href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(14)00257-7.pdf">evolutionary
                mismatch</a>”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and
                describes how behaviors that once helped us survive now
                work against our wellbeing. For most of human history,
                conserving energy and seeking quick rewards were
                essential for survival. Brains that chose certain, easy
                rewards over uncertain future benefits were the ones
                that lived to reproduce.</p>
                <p>The struggle comes from processes running at
                different priority levels<a href="#fn3"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>: your evolutionary
                brain operates with high priority, optimizing for
                immediate survival, while your conscious mind runs in
                the background trying to optimize for long-term meaning
                and growth.</p>
                <p>These consumptive behaviors often function as
                sophisticated counterfeits of the real thing. I recently
                stumbled across comedian Jimmy Carr in <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8mlrSIMhD8&amp;list=WL&amp;index=2">an
                interview</a> (don’t bristle at the title! it’s a good
                video) and was genuinely surprised with what he had to
                say! He captured this perfectly: video games serve as “a
                proxy for career” while online porn acts as “a proxy for
                sex.” These activities provide the neurochemical rewards
                of real accomplishment and connection without any of the
                actual benefits:</p>

                </div>
                <p>All of these consumptive behaviors (the scrolling,
                the videos, etc.) are forms of mental escape from the
                present moment. They pull us away from engaging with
                what’s actually in front of us.</p>
                <p>This creates a dangerous cycle. The more you give in
                to consumptive behaviors, the harder generative ones
                become to start. Eventually, you find yourself in what
                feels like a dark, dull pit—going through the motions of
                easy pleasures that no longer even feel that good, while
                the meaningful activities that could lift you out seem
                impossibly difficult to begin. Like Huxley’s soma<a
                href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, these easy
                pleasures numb us to the richer rewards that come from
                actual engagement with life.</p>

                <p>I wish I could offer a clear path forward, but
                honestly, I’m still working through this cycle myself.
                Part of me keeps hoping I’ll stumble across some font of
                inspiration that will suddenly make everything clear. I
                recognize real change requires the hard work of building
                new habits day by day. I’ve identified the problem and
                understand the psychology behind it, but I’m still in
                the messy middle of actually changing. I fall back into
                old patterns regularly, but I’m learning.</p>
                <p>Given how ubiquitous these behaviors are, this seems
                to be the defining challenge of our digital age
                (especially with the emergence of AI, which can be
                profoundly consumptive when used as a replacement for
                thinking rather than a tool to enhance it).</p>
                <p>I plan to revisit this post as I experiment with
                different approaches and hopefully develop some
                practical insights. For now, I have clearer language for
                what I’m fighting against. I’d be curious to hear what
