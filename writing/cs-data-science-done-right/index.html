                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                <p>I am what feels like moments away from finishing my
                double major in Computer Science and Data Science, and
                I’ll be receiving my piece of paper from UW-Madison soon
                (knock on wood). While I’m double majoring, I consider
                myself a Computer Scientist first, which is why it
                caught my attention when, during my time hanging around
                my Comp Sci friends, I heard over and over, “data
                science is a fake major!”—Now, granted, at my university
                I can understand the sentiment. At UW-Madison, if you
                start as a CS major, you only need to tack on five
                additional classes to get Data Science. And there’s
                definitely a minimum resistance path where students can
                “skirt through” the more information-dense and
                challenging courses and learn essentially nothing. I’m
                writing this today to share what I did and how I feel I
                will leave UW not clueless about data science, but
                relatively well-versed in the tools of the Data
                Scientist.</p>
                <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>I’m going to share with you <em>my</em> path. While
                I’m convinced it’s near optimal with regard to a balance
                of content and time efficiency, it is not the only path
                that will leave you feeling fulfilled. As always: use a
                combination of

                (for professor reviews) to guarantee you don’t shoot
                yourself in the foot. <strong>As a general rule, I have
                never taken a professor with a rating ≤
                2.7.</strong></p>

                <h3 id="the-boilerplate">The Boilerplate</h3>
                <p>The boilerplate in the Data Science major is the set
                of classes I had to go through no matter what: the R
                programming and tidyverse tutorial
                (<abbr title="Data Science Modeling I">STAT 240</abbr>),
                AP Stats 2.0
                (<abbr title="Data Science Modeling II">STAT
                340</abbr>), and the yucky gobbledygook of intro to
                “data science programming,” a.k.a. Python
                (<abbr title="Data Science Programming I">CS 220</abbr>
                &amp; <abbr title="Data Science Programming II">CS
                320</abbr>). I endured that slog, and then I was out!
                Only interesting classes remain.</p>
                <h3 id="good-courses">Good Courses</h3>
                <p>Since I was a computer science major first, I had
                already set my sights on a few interesting classes with
                ties to data science. I’d already tackled
                <abbr title="Introduction to Algorithms">CS 577</abbr>,
                which covered greedy algorithms, divide and conquer,
                dynamic programming, and computational complexity. This
                course provided the theoretical foundation that makes
                understanding distributed systems possible.</p>
                <p>First and foremost, I took big data systems with
                Tyler Caraza-Harter
                (<abbr title="Introduction to Big Data Systems">CS
                544</abbr>), where I learned how massive tech companies
                actually handle billions of users’ data using tools like
                Spark and Hadoop, which companies like Meta use to
                process their 4 petabytes of daily data. That same
                semester, I took databases with AnHai Doan
                (<abbr title="Database Management Systems: Design and Implementation">CS
                564</abbr>), which taught me the theory of how databases
                work under the hood. We only spent a week on SQL, and
                AnHai joked that if I couldn’t understand it by that
                point, I should take a community college course! Valid
                and refreshing. The real focus was on things like how
                databases physically store data on disk, buffer
                management, and B+ tree indexing.</p>
                <p>I also took
                <abbr title="Statistical Data Visualization">STAT
                436</abbr> to learn precisely when to use precisely what
                data visualization to represent data.</p>
                <h3 id="great-courses">Great Courses</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite classes period was
                <abbr title="Data Exploration, Cleaning, and Integration for Data Science">CS
                774</abbr> with AnHai. I liked his databases class in
                the fall, so I sought out his grad class in the spring.
                This was incredibly worth it because it broke down how
                things <em>actually</em> work in the real world. It
                dissipated a lot of the cloudy naïveté I had as an
                undergraduate about data science being clean datasets
                and straightforward analysis. In the real world, data is
                messy, fragmented, and low-quality. Most of your time is
                spent on data wrangling—acquiring, cleaning, matching,
                and integrating data sources. It takes a lot of work to
                even begin to <em>think</em> about insights. AnHai’s
                blunt, practical approach (“Nobody wants to give you
                data… take them out for Indian food and fill them with
                beer” and his favorite reminder that “Nothing is free in
                life!”) honestly stripped away a lot of my academic
                idealism and prepared me for the actual challenges I’d
                face as a data scientist.</p>
                <p>This upcoming semester, I will take
                <abbr title="Matrix Methods in Machine Learning">CS
                532</abbr>. It covers linear algebraic foundations of
                machine learning with real-world applications from
                classification and clustering to denoising and data
                analysis. Topics include linear equations, regression,
                regularization, singular value decomposition, support
                vector machines, kernel methods, clustering, and neural
                networks. It’s the talk of the town and dear god has it
                been hard to get into. But I’ve finally got it.</p>
                <h2 id="an-internship-helps">An Internship Helps</h2>
                <p>Like it or not, skills are forged in fire and a data
                science internship is a perfect opportunity to test your
                mettle. It’s a rough market, but if you look high and
                low, and commit yourself, I have no doubt you will find
                a window of opportunity.</p>
                <p>An internship is great because it situates you (the
                data scientist/software engineer) within the broader
                structure of a business. I was quickly inundated with
                talk of
                <abbr title="Key Performance Indicators">KPIs</abbr> and
                deliverables. I learned to frame my accomplishments in a
                way my audience would understand—either at the strategic
                or tactical level<sup class="fnref"><a href="#fn1" id="note1" title="Footnote 1">1</a></sup><span class="footnote" id="fn1"><a class="fnref" href="#note1" title="Footnote 1 Reference">1</a> Strategic level focuses on high-level
                business goals and long-term impact (e.g., “This model
                increased customer retention by 15%”). Tactical level
                focuses on specific technical implementations and
                immediate deliverables (e.g., “Built a feature
                engineering pipeline that reduced processing time by
                40%”).</span>.</p>
                <p>I learned how to interact with other human beings,
                work together, hash out issues and team up. I learned
                how gritty real-world data is, how messy a database can
                be, and what silly company policies make your idealism
                fade quickly away and get replaced with the vigor of
                “I’m working with what I’ve got and that’s okay.”</p>
                <p>It’s frustrating, it’s wonderful, and you learn a
                ton.</p>
                <h2
                id="comparing-math-stats-and-ds-for-cs-majors">Comparing
                Math, Stats, and DS for CS Majors</h2>
                <p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words:</p>
                <p><img src="./images/venn.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Data Science Venn Diagram" width="250" height="250" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></p>
                <p>As a hybrid major, data science gives you a taste of
                everything but mastery of none. The diagram above shows
                the reality of what this field actually is—not a
                standalone discipline, but the overlap between three
                distinct areas of expertise.</p>
                <p>Pairing CS with a more “pure” major like Math or
                Statistics avoids some of the dregs you encounter in
                hybrid programs. You skip the watered-down intro courses
                designed for people who’ve never coded before. You avoid
                the awkward positioning where you’re getting a diluted
                version of mathematical concepts filtered through a
                “data science” lens.</p>
                <p>Instead, you develop deep mathematical or statistical
                maturity that carries you far beyond any specific tool
                or framework. Real analysis teaches you to think
                rigorously about limits and continuity—and yes, working
                through Rudin (our own UW-Madison Walter Rudin’s
                <em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em>) will make
                you a fundamentally better thinker. Advanced statistical
                theory gives you the foundation to understand why
                methods work, not just how to apply them.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, there is hardly a more efficient
                pathway than CS + Data Science for getting exposure to
                the entire ecosystem. You touch machine learning,
                databases, visualization, big data systems, and business
                applications all within a structured curriculum. For
                someone who wants to get into the field quickly and
                start contributing, it’s hard to beat.</p>
                <p>That said, if I had to do it all over again, I think
                I’d choose CS + Math or CS + Stats. The mathematical
                maturity you develop creates a foundation that
                transcends any particular technology.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, the choice depends on your goals: breadth
                and efficiency (CS + DS) or depth and long-term
                foundation (CS + Math/Stats). No matter which option you
                choose, the key is intentionally taking the right
                classes and collecting the right skills, rather than
                opting for the easy road, collecting credentials, and
                walking out the door.</p>
