                <p>I have been roleplaying and building worlds for a
                decade this May<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In that
                time, I’ve learned a tremendous amount about what works
                in worldbuilding and how to build player trust as a game
                master<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (GM). When I’m not
                at the table with friends, I’m programming—graduating
                soon with a Computer Science and Data Science degree
                from the <a href="https://cdis.wisc.edu/">University of
                Wisconsin-Madison</a>. The creative challenges faced by
                worldbuilding GMs parallel those of software engineers,
                particularly in managing complexity, sustaining creative
                momentum, and designing flexible systems that adapt to
                change.</p>
                <p>Creating homebrew worlds mirrors designing software.
                The worldbuilding process is an asymptotic journey
                toward an ideal. You begin with an empty canvas, add and
                strip away elements, and refine towards a “just right”
                state that can never be fully reached. This gap between
                vision and implementation persists regardless of effort
                invested. At the end of this process, the creator has
                established consistent rules and a living, breathing
                fantasy world.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This model works equally well for programming.
                Programmers build “worlds” of their own, maintaining
                coherence internally through well-structured code and
                externally through intuitive interfaces. We design data
                structures, algorithms, and establish design patterns.
                Like worldbuilders, programmers must understand how each
                component affects the entire system.</p>
                <p>One challenge in both disciplines is adding new
                elements without disrupting the existing system. As a
                GM, when I introduce a new culture or type of magic, I
                must weave it into existing lore without creating
                contradictions. When I created a seafaring merchant
                kingdom (Tayrest on map A), I ensured their cultural
                practices made sense given their proximity to existing
                nations. Similarly, software engineers adding features
                must ensure compatibility with existing functionality
                while avoiding regression issues. In both domains, you
                must anticipate how additions will ripple through your
                creation.</p>
                <p>This extends to knowledge management, where both
                roles struggle with documentation debt. Many GMs compile
                extensive <a
                href="https://hatch-books.com/blog/world-bible">world
                wikis</a>, campaign notes, and NPC directories that
                gradually become unwieldy. Software engineers face
                identical challenges with technical documentation that
                quickly falls out of sync with evolving codebases. The
                struggle to maintain current reference materials creates
                friction that compounds over time.</p>
                <p>Both disciplines require creators to balance
                ambitious ideas with practical constraints. The art lies
                in crafting worlds resilient enough to evolve without
                collapsing under their own complexity.</p>

                <li id="fn1"><p>Over the years, I’ve explored roleplay
                across many mediums, from Star Wars forum RP and MMOs to
                tabletop games like D&amp;D 5e. During COVID, I invested
                heavily in both DayZ roleplay and a 42-week D&amp;D
                campaign with friends (June 13, 2021 to August 7,
                2022—with my friends from high school), which cemented
                my focus on tabletop RPGs. I learned a ton about
                worldbuilding and “on the fly” planning during those 14
                months. Going with the flow became just as important as
                preparation.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

                <p>When designing a world or software, it takes
                willpower to stop adding more. I hyperfixate on current
                projects and build them up with all my creative energy.
                But you’re not building the world to build the
                world—you’re building it to tell a story! And the most
                important part is how it ends: a refined, precise,
                complete story that serves a purpose. The world is
                merely a tool to deliver that story to your players.</p>
                <p>I’ve learned this the hard way. I once spent weeks
                crafting an elaborate side quest involving ancient ruins
                with detailed political backstory, custom monsters, and
                three different possible outcomes. I was so excited to
                unveil it. The players walked right past every hint I
                dropped, completely ignored the mysterious NPCs trying
                to guide them there, and decided to start a tavern
                business instead<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. All
                that preparation became expensive scratch paper.</p>
                <p>Building intricacies in my world is therapeutic, but
                I have to rein myself in and remember that while my mind
                has near-bottomless capacity for this, my players have
                limited mental bandwidth and
                <strong><em>playtime</em></strong>. Much of what I
                create will never see the light of day, and it
                shouldn’t. Players can only absorb so much information
                during sessions, and what seems crystal clear to me
                often gets lost in translation.</p>
                <p>Software engineers face this same struggle. The
                excitement of introducing new functionality can lead to
                bloated codebases that become difficult to maintain and
                confusing for users. Developers must remember that users
                want software that solves their problems efficiently,
                not necessarily software that does everything
                imaginable.</p>
                <p>Learning to design a refined, precise, and complete
                world—rather than an endlessly expanding
                one—distinguishes the very best creators. I’ve found
                that balancing enough content to make the system feel
                hearty and fully fleshed out, without creating an
                overwhelming noise-to-signal ratio, is one of the
                hardest skills to develop.</p>

                out of it to gather information, and it gave them
                something meaningful to spend gold on, reducing gold
                inflation. Sometimes the players’ ideas are way better
                than yours.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"

                <h2 id="preventing-burnout">Preventing Burnout</h2>
                <p>The creative drive that fuels both worldbuilding and
                programming can be all-consuming. I’ve definitely had
                nights up past 3 AM sketching political conflicts
                between fictional kingdoms or perfecting an NPC’s
                backstory my players might never even meet. This passion
                is a double-edged sword, driving creation but leading to
                burnout when unchecked.</p>
                <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="./images/wikia.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of wiki-style lore respositories I've written with hundreds of pages" style="width: 80%; margin: 15px auto;">

                <p>Game masters often feel pressure to constantly
                innovate, balancing preparation with improvisation as
                player actions derail planned scenarios. After months of
                this cycle, even the most enthusiastic GM can find their
                creative well running dry. The cruel irony is that the
                hobby once chosen as an escape transforms into something
                they themselves now feel the need to escape from.</p>
                <p>Software developers battle similar demons. The
                pressure to deliver features, fix bugs, meet deadlines,
                and stay current with evolving technologies creates a
                perfect storm for burnout. Both roles demand a constant
                outpouring of creative and technical solutions, with
                limited recognition of the mental cost.</p>
                <p>I’ve learned that boundaries are essential. “But
                Nico-Nico! Does that mean you advocating for work-life
                balance? And in this economy!?” I think so. For GMs,
                this might mean limiting worldbuilding to defined time
                blocks. For developers, it means timeboxing problems and
                recognizing when good enough is truly good enough. As my
                professor AnHai Doan once said, <strong><em>“There is
                nothing perfect in life!”</em></strong></p>
                <p>I’ve had to learn not to be afraid to prioritize
                self-care. If you’re overwhelmed, cancel a session—your
                players <em>will</em> understand. While software
                engineering sometimes requires sprints for critical
                deadlines, I’ve found it’s important to balance these
                with recovery time. Your mental health deserves
                protection, and well-rested work will always outshine
                what you create while exhausted.</p>
                <p>The bottom line: pace yourself. Some weeks that means
                canceling a session to recharge. Other weeks it means
                pulling an all-nighter because you’re genuinely excited
                about what you’re building! Make those choices
                consciously, not out of obligation. Be sustainable and
                know your limits.</p>
                <h2 id="adapting-to-change">Adapting to Change</h2>
                <p>One of the most important lessons from a decade of
                GMing is that player agency is sacred.</p>
                <p>For players to truly invest in your world, they must
                know <em>unequivocally</em> that their choices matter.
                This trust isn’t built through elaborate pre-scripted
                monologues that rival <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjgUXY4U3JI">Lelouch’s
                “Obey Me, World”</a>, or <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0hV5MtC4Vw">meticulous,
                Mercer-tier narrations</a>, but through your consistent
                willingness to adapt your creation to your players’
                decisions.</p>
                <p>I learned this the hard way when I prepared an entire
                plot hook around a conspicuous character who would offer
                the party a job and help them resist the oppressive
                government. I had this whole rebellion storyline planned
                out. Instead, my players turned that character in to the
                authorities and started helping who I was trying to
                assert was the “enemy!”<a href="#fn4"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> I had to completely
                redesign the campaign on the fly, turning my carefully
                crafted rebels into the antagonists and making the
                authoritarian regime actually reasonable. It was
                terrifying but became one of our best story arcs.</p>
                <p>Many of my most memorable moments came from sessions
                where I hadn’t looked at my prepared notes for
                hours—situations where players pursued unexpected
                threads and things “flew off the rails” in a good way!
                These moments, while nerve-wracking, are where the magic
                happens. When you’re comfortable enough with your world
                to seamlessly improvise while appearing prepared,
                players become genuinely immersed. Conversely, when you
                railroad players along predetermined paths, their
                engagement evaporates as they realize they’re merely
                pawns in your<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
                story.</p>
                <p>Software development follows a similar pattern. My
                most successful coding projects have been those where I
                remained flexible to changing requirements rather than
                clinging to initial designs. Just as a good GM adapts
                their world to player choices, effective programmers
                adapt and refactor their code to best handle real-world
                usage patterns. Creation isn’t a linear process but a
                dialogue between GM and players, or between developers
                and users.</p>
                <p>I’ve found that the willingness to adapt reveals a
                difference in perspective that separates beginners from
                veterans: recognizing that creation isn’t about
                executing a predetermined plan, but maintaining the
                invariant that whatever you build can actively evolve to
                accommodate ongoing feedback. If you build from the
                outset with flexibility in mind, you don’t have a messy
                web anymore, but an organized map. This mindset
                transforms rigid structures into living frameworks
                capable of becoming something better than initially
                imagined.</p>

                encounter to buy me time to figure out what to do next.
                The lesson: always have a random encounter table ready
                for when your players completely derail your carefully
                laid plans.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"

                They allocate time and trust to you. The same principle
                applies to software: technical brilliance means nothing
                if it doesn’t solve users’ problems in an intuitive
                way.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"

                <h2 id="collaborating">Collaborating</h2>
                <p>At its core, worldbuilding thrives on collaboration.
                My most memorable roleplaying scenarios weren’t those
                with the deepest lore or perfectly balanced encounters.
                Instead, they emerged organically from how my players’
                choices interwove with the framework I provided. The
                world was alive because I wasn’t its only author.</p>
                <p>The best software, too, evolves through consistent
                dialogue between creators and users. Open source
                projects demonstrate this perfectly: communities of
                developers contributing to codebases that exceed what
                any individual could create alone. Even proprietary
                software benefits from beta testing<a href="#fn6"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
                role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, user feedback
                loops, and cross-functional teams.</p>
                <p>I’ve noticed different types of collaboration in both
                domains. Sometimes it’s planned—like co-creating a
                campaign setting with players during a “session zero,”
                or developers working together through agile
                methodologies. Other times it’s emergent—players develop
                complex relationships between their characters that I
                could never have anticipated, or users discover
                innovative uses for software features that developers
                never imagined. And sometimes it’s feedback-driven
                evolution, where I redesign entire campaign arcs based
                on unexpected player decisions, or product teams pivot
                features based on user behavior.</p>
                <p>Both disciplines require balancing creative vision
                with what the audience actually wants. This means
                <strong>maintaining the humility to recognize when your
                brilliant idea isn’t working</strong>, and the
                flexibility to adapt.</p>
                <p>The most rewarding creative experiences happen when
                we step back from being the sole author and create
                spaces where others can contribute meaningfully. This
                doesn’t diminish our work—it enhances it, transforming
                our initial ideas into something far richer than we
                could have built alone.</p>

                really should be hiring a specialized team.<a

                <h2 id="using-what-you-have">Using What You Have</h2>
                <p>Both game masters and programmers must balance
                technical mastery with creative expression. As a GM,
                I’ve spent hundreds of hours perfecting homebrewed game
                elements and designing balanced encounters—the technical
                foundation that supports creative storytelling.
                Similarly, in programming, clean code architecture
                provides the foundation for innovative features and an
                enjoyable user experience.</p>
                <p>In both disciplines, the technical and creative
                elements are inseparable. I could have the most
                brilliant narrative concept, but it would fall flat
                without solid game mechanics. I could have the most
                elegant helper function, but if the feature doesn’t make
                sense, it is wasted.</p>
                <p>I’ve learned to develop both sides of this equation,
                using technical constraints to inspire creative
                solutions rather than seeing them as limitations.</p>
                <h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
                <p>I’ve highlighted the interesting parallels that exist
                for game masters and software developers. Worldbuilding
                is a generalizable skill in disciplines where you
                create, and lessons from one domain consistently enrich
                practices in the other.</p>
                <p>Whether crafting magical realms or coding projects,
                common challenges include managing complexity, avoiding
                feature bloat, preventing burnout, and adapting to
                unexpected changes. Success in either field requires
                understanding how what you build interfaces with the
                user. Are we building with them in mind?</p>
                <p>Perhaps most importantly, both disciplines teach
                humility. No matter how brilliant our creations seem in
                our minds, their true value lies in how they serve
                others. The perfect world only exists in our minds; our
                job is to create the best approximation in the time we
                have. By embracing these constraints rather than
                fighting them, we open ourselves to discoveries and
                collaborations that far surpass the original vision.</p>
                <p>I plan to continue worldbuilding, both as a software
                engineer and a game master, for the foreseeable future.
                May your own creative endeavors, whatever form they
                take, benefit from the wisdom worldbuilding has to
                offer.</p>
