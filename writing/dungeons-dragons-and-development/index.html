            <p>Creating custom (“homebrew”) D&amp;D worlds and
            developing software are surprisingly similar as creative
            disciplines. In both, you create vast interconnected
            “worlds” which must remain cohesive while evolving over
            time.</p>

            role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (GM). When I’m not at
            the table with friends, I’m programming – graduating soon
            with a Computer Sciences degree from the <a
            href="https://cdis.wisc.edu/">University of
            Wisconsin-Madison</a>. The creative challenges faced by
            worldbuilding GMs parallel those of software engineers,
            particularly in managing complexity, sustaining creative
            momentum, and designing flexible systems that adapt to
            change.</p>
            <h2 id="building-worlds">Building Worlds</h2>
            <p>Creating homebrew worlds mirrors designing software. The
            worldbuilding process is an asymptotic journey toward an
            ideal. You begin with an empty canvas, add and strip away
            elements, and refine towards a “just right” state that can
            never be fully reached. This gap between vision and
            implementation persists regardless of effort invested. At
            the end of this process, the creator has established
            consistent rules and a living, breathing fantasy world.</p>

            <p>This model works equally well for programming.
            Programmers build “worlds” of their own, maintaining
            coherence internally through well-structured code and
            externally through intuitive interfaces. We design data
            structures, algorithms, and establish design patterns. Like
            worldbuilders, programmers must understand how each
            component affects the entire system.</p>
            <p>One challenge in both disciplines is adding new elements
            without disrupting the existing system. As a GM, when I
            introduce a new culture or type of magic, I must weave it
            into existing lore without creating contradictions. When I
            created a seafaring merchant kingdom (Tayrest on map A), I
            ensured their cultural practices made sense given their
            proximity to existing nations. Similarly, software engineers
            adding features must ensure compatibility with existing
            functionality while avoiding regression issues. In both
            domains, you must anticipate how additions will ripple
            through your creation.</p>
            <p>This extends to knowledge management, where both roles
            struggle with documentation debt. Many GMs compile extensive
            <a href="https://hatch-books.com/blog/world-bible">world
            wikis</a>, campaign notes, and NPC directories that
            gradually become unwieldy. Software engineers face identical
            challenges with technical documentation that quickly falls
            out of sync with evolving codebases. The struggle to
            maintain current reference materials creates friction that
            compounds over time.</p>
            <p>In summary, both disciplines creators balance ambitious
            ideas with practical constraints. The art lies in crafting
            worlds resilient enough to evolve without collapsing under
            their own complexity.</p>
            <h2 id="fighting-bloat-and-feature-creep">Fighting Bloat and
            Feature Creep</h2>
            <p>When designing a world or software, it takes willpower to
            stop adding more. I hyperfixate on current projects and
            build them up with all my creative energy. But you’re not
            building the world to build the world – you’re building it
            to tell a story! And the most important part is how it ends:
            a refined, precise, complete story that serves a purpose.
            The world is merely a tool to deliver that story to your
            players.</p>
            <p>Building intricacies in my world is therapeutic, but I
            have to rein myself in and remember that while my mind has
            near-bottomless capacity for this, my players have limited
            mental bandwidth and <strong><em>playtime</em></strong>.
            Much of what I create will never see the light of day, and
            it shouldn’t. Players can only absorb so much information
            during sessions, and what seems crystal clear to me often
            gets lost in translation.</p>
            <p>Software engineers face this same struggle. The
            excitement of introducing new functionality can lead to
            bloated codebases that become difficult to maintain and
            confusing for users. Developers must remember that users
            want software that solves their problems efficiently, not
            necessarily software that does everything imaginable.</p>
            <p>The focus to design a refined, precise, and complete
            world – rather than an endlessly expanding one –
            distinguishes the very best creators. One must balance
            introducing enough content that the system feels hearty and
            fully fleshed out, but not so much as to create an
            overwhelming noise-to-signal ratio.</p>
            <h2 id="preventing-burnout">Preventing Burnout</h2>
            <p>The creative drive that fuels both worldbuilding and
            programming can be all-consuming. I’ve definitely had nights
            up past 3 AM sketching political conflicts between fictional
            kingdoms or perfecting an NPC’s backstory my players might
            never even meet. This passion is a double-edged sword,
            driving creation but leading to burnout when unchecked.</p>
            <figure style="text-align: center">
            <img src="./images/wikia.webp" alt="Screenshot of wiki-style lore respositories I've written with hundreds of pages" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">

            </figure>
            <p>Game masters often feel pressure to constantly innovate,
            balancing preparation with improvisation as player actions
            derail planned scenarios. After months of this cycle, even
            the most enthusiastic GM can find their creative well
            running dry. The cruel irony is that the hobby once chosen
            as an escape transforms into something they themselves now
            feel the need to escape from.</p>
            <p>Software developers battle similar demons. The pressure
            to deliver features, fix bugs, meet deadlines, and stay
            current with evolving technologies creates a perfect storm
            for burnout. Both roles demand a constant outpouring of
            creative and technical solutions, with limited recognition
            of the mental cost.</p>
            <p>Boundaries are good. “But Nico-Nico! Does that mean you
            advocating for work-life balance? And in this economy!?” I
            think so. For GMs, this might mean limiting worldbuilding to
            defined time blocks. For developers, it means timeboxing
            problems and recognizing when good enough is truly good
            enough. As my professor AnHai Doan once said,
            <strong><em>“There is nothing perfect in
            life!”</em></strong></p>
            <p>Don’t be afraid to prioritize self-care. If you’re
            overwhelmed, cancel a session – your players <em>will</em>
            understand. While software engineering sometimes requires
            sprints for critical deadlines, balance these with recovery
            time. Your mental health deserves protection, and
            well-rested work will always outshine what you create while
            exhausted.</p>
            <p>The bottom line: pace yourself. Some weeks that means
            canceling a session to recharge. Other weeks it means
            pulling an all-nighter because you’re genuinely excited
            about what you’re building! Make those choices consciously,
            not out of obligation. Be sustainable and know your
            limits.</p>
            <h2 id="adaptating-to-change">Adaptating to Change</h2>
            <p>One of the most important lessons from a decade of GMing
            is that player agency is sacred.</p>
            <p>For players to truly invest in your world, they must know
            <em>unequivocally</em> that their choices matter. This trust
            isn’t built through elaborate pre-scripted monologues that
            rival <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjgUXY4U3JI">Lelouch’s
            “Obey Me, World”</a>, or <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0hV5MtC4Vw">meticulous,
            Mercer-tier narrations</a>, but through your consistent
            willingness to adapt your creation to your players’
            decisions.</p>
            <p>Many moments that have stuck with me came from sessions
            where I hadn’t looked at my prepared notes for hours –
            situations where players pursued unexpected threads and
            things “flew off the rails” in a good way! These moments,
            while nerve-wracking, are where the magic happens. When
            you’re comfortable enough with your world to seamlessly
            improvise while appearing prepared, players become genuinely
            immersed. Conversely, when you railroad players along
            predetermined paths, their engagement evaporates as they
            realize they’re merely pawns in your<a href="#fn3"
            class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> story.</p>
            <p>Software development follows a similar pattern. My most
            successful coding projects have been those where I remained
            flexible to changing requirements rather than clinging to
            initial designs. Just as a good GM adapts their world to
            player choices, effective programmers adapt and refactor
            their code to best handle real-world usage patterns.
            Creation isn’t a linear process but a dialogue between GM
            and players, or between developers and users.</p>
            <p>The willingness to adapt reveals a difference in
            perspective that separates beginners from veterans:
            recognizing that creation isn’t about executing a
            predetermined plan, but maintaining the invariant that
            whatever you build can actively evolve to accommodate
            ongoing feedback. If you build from the outset with control
            in mind, you don’t have a messy web anymore, but an
            organized map. This mindset transforms rigid structures into
            living frameworks capable of becoming something better than
            initially imagined.</p>
            <h2 id="collaborating">Collaborating</h2>
            <p>At its core, worldbuilding thrives on collaboration. My
            most memorable roleplaying scenarios weren’t those with the
            deepest lore or perfectly balanced encounters. Instead, they
            emerged organically from how my players’ choices interwove
            with the framework I provided. The world was alive because I
            wasn’t its only author.</p>
            <p>The best software, too, evolves through consistent
            dialogue between creators and users. Open source projects
            demonstrate this perfectly: communities of developers
            contributing to codebases that exceed what any individual
            could create alone. Even proprietary software benefits from
            beta testing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
            role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, user feedback loops,
            and cross-functional teams.</p>
            <p>Different types of collaboration appear in both
            domains:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Planned collaboration</strong> occurs when
            multiple creators intentionally work together toward defined
            goals. For game masters, this might mean co-creating a
            campaign setting with players during a “session zero,” while
            developers achieve this through agile
            methodologies.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Emergent collaboration</strong> happens when
            users unexpectedly extend or transform the original
            creation. Players develop complex relationships between
            their characters that I could never have anticipated, or
            users discover innovative uses for software features that
            developers never imagined.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Feedback-driven evolution</strong> is another
            mode where creators respond to how their work is actually
            used rather than how they assumed it would be used. I’ve
            redesigned entire campaign arcs based on unexpected player
            decisions; similarly, product teams pivot features based on
            user behavior.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both disciplines require balancing creative vision with
            what the audience actually wants. This means maintaining the
            humility to recognize when your brilliant idea isn’t
            working, and the flexibility to adapt.</p>
            <p>The most rewarding creative experiences happen when we
            step back from being the sole author and create spaces where
            others can contribute meaningfully. This doesn’t diminish
            our work – it enhances it, transforming our initial ideas
            into something far richer than we could have built
            alone.</p>
            <h2 id="using-what-you-have">Using What You Have</h2>
            <p>Both game masters and programmers must balance technical
            mastery with creative expression. As a GM, I’ve spent
            hundreds of hours perfecting homebrewed game elements and
            designing balanced encounters – the technical foundation
            that supports creative storytelling. Similarly, in
            programming, clean code architecture provides the foundation
            for innovative features and an enjoyable user
            experience.</p>
            <p>In both disciplines, the technical and creative elements
            are inseparable. I could have the most brilliant narrative
            concept, but it would fall flat without solid game
            mechanics. I could have the most elegant helper function,
            but if the feature doesn’t make sense, it is wasted.</p>
            <p>You have to develop both sides of this equation, using
            technical constraints to inspire creative solutions rather
            than seeing them as limitations.</p>
            <p>Use what you have, keep it simple, question
            everything.</p>
            <h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
            <p>I’ve highlighted the interesting parallels that exist for
            game masters and software developers. Worldbuilding is a
            generalizable skill in disciplines where you create, and
            lessons from one domain consistently enrich practices in the
            other.</p>
            <p>Whether crafting magical realms or coding projects,
            common challenges include managing complexity, avoiding
            feature bloat, preventing burnout, and adapting to
            unexpected changes. Success in either field requires
            understanding how what you build interfaces with the user.
            Are we building with them in mind?</p>
            <p>Perhaps most importantly, both disciplines teach
            humility. No matter how brilliant our creations seem in our
            minds, their true value lies in how they serve others. The
            perfect world only exists in our minds; our job is to create
            the best approximation in the time we have. By embracing
            these constraints rather than fighting them, we open
            ourselves to discoveries and collaborations that far surpass
            the original vision.</p>
            <p>I plan to continue worldbuilding, both as a software
            engineer and a game master, for the foreseeable future. May
            your own creative endeavors, whatever form they take,
            benefit from the wisdom worldbuilding has to offer.</p>
