<h1><span>Hi, I'm Nico!</span></h1>
<p>
    Welcome to my website. I write about computing, history, and philosophy. My technical interests span machine learning, multi-agent systems, and performance-oriented backends. I work with <span style="color: #3776ab">Python</span>, <span style="color: #00add8">Go</span>, <span style="color: #ce422b">Rust</span>, <span style="color: #5967d8">C</span>, and <span style="color: #3178c6">TypeScript</span>. I enjoy building things that need to be fast and scale well.
</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>
    I avoid being prescriptive and instead prefer to frame my experiences and how I've learned or grown from them. I <a href="/writing">write about</a> programming, statistics, psychology, philosophy, and history.
</p>
<p>
    Writing helps me think. I welcome critiques, fact checking, and fresh angles I didn't consider. Reach me at {% include "email.njk" %}!
</p>

<h2>Studies</h2>
<p>
    I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Computer Sciences. I spend most of my time hanging out in the
    <a href="https://upl.cs.wisc.edu/" target="blank">UPL</a> on campus with my friends.
</p>
<p>Some of my favorite classes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Theory of Multi-agent Machine Learning (<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vlatakis" target="_blank">Manolis Vlatakis</a>)</li>
    <li>Game Theory, Learning and Optimization (<a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~vlatakis" target="_blank">Manolis Vlatakis</a>)</li>
    <li>Parallel and High Throughput Computing (<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sifakis/" target="_blank">Efty Sifakis</a>)</li>
    <li>Operating Systems (<a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swift" target="_blank">Michael Swift</a>)</li>
    <li>Distributed Systems (<a href="https://tyler.caraza-harter.com/" target="_blank">Tyler Caraza-Harter</a>)</li>
</ul>
<small>Note: The first three courses listed are graduate-level</small>

<h2>Colophon</h2>
<p>
    A colophon is a brief statement that appears at the end of a book, providing information about its production. I got the idea from <a href="https://www.amoses.dev/" target="_blank">Andrew</a>:
</p>
<p>
    The site is intentionally minimal, built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">Eleventy</a> and plain HTML/CSS. JavaScript is sparse; I only include what's needed for MathJax on posts with equations, a table of contents, margin notes, and category filtering. Images get optimized automatically during the build.

<p>If you'd like to link back to my site, feel free to use my <code>88x31</code> button—a nod to the early web:</p>
