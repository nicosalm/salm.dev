                about me
            </h2>
            <p>
                To be honest, I didn't grow up fascinated by computers. Sure, I liked modding games and breaking things in ways developers never intended. I was always the person people sought for tech problems. But it wasn't until late in high school that I discovered my passion for actually programming and creating software. I found this interest by connecting it to my other passions: creating with imagination, building worlds, drawing, and visualizing scenes from books. Computer science became just like any other canvas for me. Except that its tangible, and what I make can be used by others! What captivated me was understanding how systems interact beneath the surface — the gritty infrastructure creating what users experience. Today, this perspective guilds most everything I build.

                I am a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying Computer Science and Data Science. Here is a selection from my coursework:
                <ul>
                    <li>Game Theory, Learning and Optimization* (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MKutDKcAAAAJ" target="_blank" rel="norefferer noopener")>Manolis Vlatakis</a>)</li>

                Also, here are some books I've read that I feel I've learned the most from:

                    <li>Introduction to Statistical Learning</li>
                    <!--
<li>Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach (7e)</li>

                A colophon is a brief statement that appears at the end of a book, providing information about its production. I got the idea from <a href="https://www.amoses.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew</a>, and while I don't believe I will do as great a job as he did with his, here is my best shot:

                There's a running joke among my friends that I go through many websites. This one will hopefully stand the test of time. TODO
            </p>
            <p> Highlight: reduction in page weight, decrease in HTTP requests, improved load time metrics, build time improvements
                simplified dependency tree, less javascript
