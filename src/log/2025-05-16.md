# Study Log for 2025-05-16

* **Day:** 1
* **Learning stage:** Beginning Rust ([book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) & blasting through [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)); Reviewing linear algebra (via Linear Algebra Done Right)
* **Learned for:** ~4h
* **Satisfied?** Yup

## What I Learned

- Went through almost all of rustlings (I plan to finish tomorrow), good refresher and confirms I recall hat the book talked about
- Review of vector spaces and subspaces from Linear Algebra (I like that this book starts with *them* and not determinants)

## Reflection
I really hope I can be consistent with these.

## Next Steps

- Finish up rustlings and the Rust book, and then work on a project (probably [pngme](https://jrdngr.github.io/pngme_book/introduction.html))
- Keep on cooking on Linear Algebra (and eventually move on to Grander Things)
